
### Openshift ###

- Platform as a service (PaaS) that allows you to build and run applications on containers.
- It enables them to build their own provate cloud on the data center.

## How OpenShift works?
- Built on top of core technologies - Docker based containers and kubernetes system for orchestration.
- Docker is a llighweight portable format that provides imiages of an app to run on diffrerent environments. 
  It includes all dependienes needed for the app and underlying systems to get deployed and run as needed.
- Need multiple containers to ebable a production ready environment - complication like for load balancer, 
  storage mounting etc on infrastructure.
- Kubernetes is open source project created by google manages containerized apps across set of containers
  or hosts and provide mechanisms for deployment, maintenance adn app scaling while docker packages 
  instantiaites and runs containerized apps.
- Openshift is a layes on top of docker and kubernetes that makes it accessible and easy for the developer 
  to create app and platform of deployment for containers to both development and Production workloads.
- Openshift provides a web based console that makes it easy to perform needed activities like
  managing deployments, pods, creating services etc.
- It has command line tool called OC which is command line executable available for windows, apple and linux. 
  you can perform all the operations on openshift.
- Kubernetes groups resource in namespaces - user with access to namespace will always access to all 
  the resources within the namespace.
- Kubernetes provides mechanism to run containers adn scale them for production.
- Openshift heart - Pods - runs on single node adn can run one or more containers.
- The containers within a pod will share the same IP address of this pod.
- Containier define a virtual boundary of compute and memory resources and assigns them to platform
  like tomcat or mysql.
- Container spinup from an image. Openshift used docker images to spinup containers.
- Containers will communicate with the same pod via localhost.
- An app can get scaled up adn multiple pods we spinup to serve the same app.
- Each pod have its own IP address, a service is created to provide single interface for the app and
  provides the standalone IP address of its own for the app to the access.
- Routes act as load balancer across pods and DNS that provides an addressable name for app to be accessed.
- pods are deployed on nodes and share the node resources like persistent storage volumes.
- Pods are made available via services. Services are set of pods. it available to external world
  outside the cluster using route.
- the management of pods is maintaned by replication controller which ensure that specified number of
  replicas of pod are running at all times.
- Build configuration - how to builf a new image to be deployed. Image can be created from 1 or 2 resources.
  It can be created from users code and base image from source to image. S2i provides builder images for
  common languagegs like PHP, ruby, Python, java. the image can be docker base build from a docker file. 
- Build config is also ted to the base images or source code via web hooks and will be updates
  automatically if change to source code or base image happens.
- enables developer to update the source code and push it to source code repositort and the webhook will
  automatically trigger the build config to get updates.
- Integrated Docker registry (IDR) used for app deployment or nodes. Openshift tracks images throught 
  image stream component.
- the deployment config defines their template for the pod and manages the deployment of new images or 
  config changes. DC as single micor service that replication controller will then manage the pod and
  keep them running.


- Open source container application platform by Red Hat based on top of Docker containers 
  and the Kubernetes container cluster manager.
- Openshift lets you easily and quickly build, develop, and deploy in nearly any infrastructure, 
  public or private. Whether it’s on-premise, in a public cloud, or hosted, you have an 
  award-winning platform to get your next big idea to market ahead of your competition.
