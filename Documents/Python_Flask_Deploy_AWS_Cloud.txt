
### Deploy Python Flask Web Application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk ###

## Local Computer ##

## Download & Install Python (choose platform) using URL - https://www.python.org/
## Virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. virtualenv creates a 
folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a 
Python project would need. It can be used standalone, in place of Pipenv.

## Sample Setup to deploy Python flask app on your local computer.
## Create Folder 'Flask' 
## Open command prompt and go to path till you find folder called 'Flask'

## Install Virtualenv by typing below command in Command prompt.
	Flask> pip install --upgrade virtualenv

## Create virtual environment called 'flaskenv' for flask application in command prompt.
	Flask> virtualenv flaskenv

## Deactivate 'flaskenv' virtualenv in command prompt (optional).
	Flask> deactivate

## Activate 'flaskenv' virtualenv in command prompt.
	Flask> flaskenv\scripts\activate.bat
	(flaskenv) Flask>

## Install Flask and gunicorn modules in comamnd prompt.
	(flaskenv) Flask> pip install --upgrade flask gunicorn awscli awsebcli

## Create file "application.py" under directory 'Flask' and paste below code

from flask import Flask # Import the Flask class from the flask module.
application = Flask(__name__) # create the app object
@application.route('/')
def index():
	return "<h2> AkashJeez Loves Coding and Racing! </h2>"

# Start the server with the 'run()' method.
if __name__ == '__main__':
	application.debug = True
	application.run()


## Create file ".ebignore" under directory 'Flask' and paste below code

flaskenv
*.pyc

## Get all modules in virtualenv 'flaskenv' and save into requirements text file.
	(flaskenv) Flask> pip freeze > requirements.txt

## Initialize your EB CLI repository with the eb init command
	(flaskenv) Flask> eb init -i
	# choose the region where it deploy
	# create new application and give app name. eg: akashjeez-flaskapp1
	# you are using python in your system, type 'y'
	# choose python version.
	# choose y or n for SSH key (no is also okay).

## Create an environment and deploy your application to it with eb create.
	(flaskenv) Flask> eb create akashjeezflaskapp1
	# environment name is akashjeezflaskapp1
	# it will create environment for this app, compress your code, move it to S3 and deploy it.

## Deploy new version after make changes on code, type below command
	(flaskenv) Flask> eb deploy akashjeezflaskapp1
	# the code is compresses and move it to s3 automatically in same environment.

## open your website in browser by below command
	(flaskenv) Flask> eb open akashjeezflaskapp1
	# url will be -> http://environmentname.subdomain.region.elasticbeanstalk.com
	# this app url -> http://akashjeezflaskapp1.4vmwmhvsem.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
